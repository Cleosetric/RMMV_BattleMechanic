# RMMV_PluginsTry
a repository for me **(a noob scripter)** trying to make plugins from concept to real code, and perhaps can be usable in real implementation.

## Range Core Mechanic
a plugins to add range mechanic to enemy and actor

**Feature list implemented**
- Add position and distance for Actor and Enemy
- Add skill range based subject position
- Add escape enemy when enemy move far away to certain distance
- Add Brave Trait to Enemy, so enemy wouldn't run away from battle
